# Enron Fraud Detection Machine Learning project

This project completes the objectives of Udacity's machine learning module in the Data Analyst Nanodegree.

Using initial algorithms, we analyze emails from Enron employees to identify persons of interest in the fraud case brought against the company.

Five algorithms were tested, written in Python and organized in a Jupyter notebook. 

Processes and results are recorded in the project.md file.
